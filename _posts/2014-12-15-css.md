Two things need to be specified in order to render `<g>` character references with a font:
	
- the name of the font
- the characters to display

If the characters are provided as text content of the `<g>` element (e.g. `<g ref="http://edirom.de/smufl-browser/_graceNoteAcciaccaturaStemUp.xml">&#xE560;</g>`), you only need to 
	specify the font in CSS. The following rule assigns the font 'BravuraText' to all `<g>` elements with a `@ref` attribute 
		starting with "http://edirom.de/smufl-browser" or "s:":
	
```
g[ref^="http://edirom.de/smufl-browser"], g[ref^="s:"] {
	font-family: "BravuraText";
	font-style: normal;
	font-weight: normal;
}
```

(Note: oXygen doesn't seem to be able to load the BravuraText font when it's referenced in a @font-face rule. If you want to use 
the font in oXygen's Author Mode, install it as a system font instead.)

When `<g>` elements are encoded as empty elements (which is recommended), code points can be provided character-wise in pure CSS. A rule to render `<g ref="s:_graceNoteAcciaccaturaStemUp"/>` might look like:
	
```
g[ref="s:_graceNoteAcciaccaturaStemUp"]:before {
	font-family: "BravuraText";
	font-style: normal;
	font-weight: normal;
	content: "\00E560";
}
```

A simple XSLT can be used to automatically extract CSS rules of this kind for all character declarations in a file.
