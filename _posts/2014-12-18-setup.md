#### Installation

In order to use the GlyphPicker plugin, add the following URL to oXygen's update sites:

`http://richard-strauss-werke.github.io/glyphpicker/update/latest.xml`

When the plugin is downloaded successfully, restart oXygen. Afterwards, the plugin panel should be added to oXygen's workspace on the right-hand side. If that's not the case, add it manually to the workspace by navigating to `Window / Show View` and selecting the plugin.


#### Check the keyboard shortcut

The default shortcut for opening the GlyphPicker panel is `Command+Shift+G` on a MAC / `Ctrl+Shift+G` on other 
systems. If shortcut is already occupied in your customization of oXygen, you need to change either oXygen's or 
the plugin's settings, see the section [Keyboard Shortcuts]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2014-12-12-shortcuts %}))


#### Add glyphs references to XML documents

In order to add a glyph reference to a document, the document has to be opened in oXygen's Text or Author view. Select the glyph from the glyph table and insert the reference by double-clicking or hitting Enter.
