#### Installation

In order to use the GlyphPicker plugin, add the following URL to oXygen's update sites:

`http://aerhard.github.io/glyphpicker/update/latest.xml`

When the plugin is downloaded successfully, restart oXygen. Afterwards, the plugin panel should be added to oXygen's workspace on the right-hand side. If that's not the case, add it manually to the workspace by navigating to `Window / Show View` and selecting the plugin.


#### Adjust the keyboard shortcut

The GlyphPicker panel can be opened with a keyboard shortcut, which defaults to `Command+P` on a MAC / `Ctrl+P` on other computers. The plugin's shortcut only opens the window if its key combination isn't occupied by oXygen. If there is a conflict, you'll either have to change the corresponding shortcut in oXygen's `Options / Keyboard Shortcuts` menu or select another shortcut for the plugin by navigating to `Options / Keyboard Shortcut` in the GlyphPicker panel.  


#### Adding glyphs references to XML documents

In order to add a glyph reference to a document, the document has to be opened in oXygen's Text or Author view. Select the glyph from the glyph table and insert the reference by double-clicking or hitting Enter. This will insert the selected glyph at the current cursor position in the XML document.
