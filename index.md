# GlyphPicker

The GlyphPicker oXygen plugin adds a glyph table component to oXygen, allowing to
browse and insert glyph references into TEI documents. The glyph tables are created
on basis of character declarations in a TEI file, which can be loaded
from a web server or from the file system.

#### Features

- Pre-configured connection to the MUFI and SMuFL glyph definitions
- Font- and image-based glyph rendering
- Template-based reference insertion
- Glyph insertion both in oXygen's Text and Author mode
- Search facilities

#### Requirements

The GlyphPicker plugin requires oXygen v15.0 or higher.
